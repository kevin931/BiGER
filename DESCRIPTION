Description: We propose BiGER, a fast and accurate Bayesian rank aggregation method for meta-analysis of ordinal data,
especially gene lists. Using a Bayesian hierarchical framework combined with variational inference, BiGER efficiently
aggregates large-scale gene lists with good accuracy, while the variance estimation procedure provides valuable insights
on source reliability for researchers. This package provides three variants of the algorithm with BiGER as the traditional
Gibbs sampling, bBiGER for bounded BiGER, and vBiGER for Variational BiGER.
