# BiGER
> A Bayesian rank aggreagtion algorithm for meta-analysis of gene lists.

This package implements a Bayesian rank aggregation algorithm for meta-analysis. In bioinformatics, a common form of data is presented as gene lists, and it is of great interest to study gene lists generated by multiple studies in the same discipline. With the rise of omics studies as well as an information overflow in the scientific literature and popular discourse, finding a consensus with interpretable results is of utmost important. This is where we come to rescue. 

Named **B**ayesian Rank Aggregation **i**n **G**enomics with **E**xtended **R**anking Schemes (BiGER), BiGER can handle a variety settings, including top-ranked studies, top-unranked studies, and a generalization with mixed studies. Turbocharged with variational inference (VI), the variational BiGER (vBiGER) achieves blazingly fast speed that rivals some of the most efficient methods in the field. Finally, given BiGER's Bayesian framework, we also provide estimates for each input study's variance, giving users a practical guideline for study selection as well as guided-investigation.

So, having read all this, why wait? Start exploring our package. As we say, you should **Dream Big and Choose BiGER**!

## Installation

Currently, this package is hosted on GitHub only. You can install this package by running the following command in R:

```R
devtools::install_github("kevin931/BiGER")
```

The `BiGER` package along with its dependencies should install seamlessly.

This package depends heavily on `Rcpp` for optimization of code because we all want to save some precious time so that we can go outside rather than sitting by our computer all day. Therefore, we require the following dependencies:

- Rcpp (>=1.0.9)
- RcppTN

This requirement is in no way stringent.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation along with tutorials and API Reference, please visit our [Official Documentation](https://biger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is automatically updated with each update.

If you prefer to build documentation on your own, refer to [this guide](https://biger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/change/build.html) for more details.

## Latest Release: Pre-release

Currently, we don't yet have an offcial release for this package. We are working hard to build a cross-language ecosystem, write a comprehensive documentation, and show you how we can dream BiGER in the future! Stay tuned.
