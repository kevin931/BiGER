# BiGER
> A Bayesian rank aggreagtion algorithm for meta-analysis of gene lists.

This package is an all-in-one CyTOF data analysis package for your experiments. From loading datasets to DR and evaluation, you have a consistent interface and readable code every step along the way. There is also support for some of ``HDCytoData``'s benchmark datasets as originally implemented in R by Weber & Soneson (2019) in [this repository](https://github.com/lmweber/HDCytoData). Why wait? Start your PyCytoData journey right here, right now! 

## Installation

Currently, this package is hosted on GitHub only. You can install this package by running the following command in R:

```R
devtools::install_github("kevin931/BiGER")
```

The `BiGER` package along with its dependencies should install seamlessly.

This package depends heavily on `Rcpp` for optimization of code because we all want to save some precious time so that we can go outside rather than sitting by our computer all day. Therefore, we require the following dependencies:

- Rcpp (>=1.0.9)
- RcppTN

This requirement is in no way stringent.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation along with tutorials and API Reference, please visit our [Official Documentation](https://biger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This is automatically updated with each update.

If you prefer to build documentation on your own, refer to [this guide](https://biger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/change/build.html) for more details.

## Latest Release: Pre-release

Currently, we don't yet have an offcial release for this package. We are working hard to build a cross-language ecosystem, write a comprehensive documentation, and show you how we can dream BiGER in the future! Stay tuned.
